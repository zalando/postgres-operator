The Postgres Operator delivers an easy to run highly-available [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
clusters on Kubernetes (K8s) powered by [Patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni).
It is configured only through Postgres manifests (CRDs) to ease integration into automated CI/CD
pipelines with no access to Kubernetes API directly, promoting infrastructure as code vs manual operations.

### Operator features

* Rolling updates on Postgres cluster changes, incl. quick minor version updates
* Live volume resize without pod restarts (AWS EBS, PVC)
* Database connection pooling with PGBouncer
* Support fast in place major version upgrade to PG13. Supports global upgrade of all clusters.
* Restore and cloning Postgres clusters (incl. major version upgrade)
* Additionally logical backups to S3 bucket can be configured
* Standby cluster from S3 WAL archive
* Configurable for non-cloud environments
* Basic credential and user management on K8s, eases application deployments
* Support for custom TLS certificates
* UI to create and edit Postgres cluster manifests
* Works well on Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, OpenShift and locally on Kind
* Support for AWS EBS gp2 to gp3 migration, supporting iops and throughput configuration

### PostgreSQL features

* Supports PostgreSQL 14, starting from 9.6+
* Streaming replication cluster via Patroni
* Point-In-Time-Recovery with
[pg_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/app-pgbasebackup.html) /
[WAL-E](https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e) via [Spilo](https://github.com/zalando/spilo)
* Preload libraries: [bg_mon](https://github.com/CyberDem0n/bg_mon),
[pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/pgstatstatements.html),

The Postgres Operator has been developed at Zalando and is being used in
production for over three years.

## Using Spilo 12 images or lower

If you are already using the Postgres operator in older version with a Spilo 12 Docker image you need to be aware of the changes for the backup path.
We introduce the major version into the backup path to smoothen the [major version upgrade](docs/administrator.md#minor-and-major-version-upgrade) that is now supported.

The new operator configuration can set a compatibility flag *enable_spilo_wal_path_compat* to make Spilo look for wal segments in the current path but also old format paths.
This comes at potential performance costs and should be disabled after a few days.

The newest Spilo image is: `registry.opensource.zalan.do/acid/spilo-14:2.1-p3`

The last Spilo 12 image is: `registry.opensource.zalan.do/acid/spilo-12:1.6-p5`
